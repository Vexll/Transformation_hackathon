Campus Location
The main campus of King Saud University is strategically located near the intersection of three main roads with entry gates on each: King Khalid Road, King Abdullah Road, and Prince Turki Bin Abdulaziz Al Awal Road. Another remarkable aspect of King Saud University's campus location is its proximity to the historic city of Diriyah, the birthplace of the first Saudi state and a UNESCO World Heritage site, and the Diriyah Gate project which is a five-minute car ride away. The campus provides access to nearby shopping malls such as The Esplanade and U Walk, both are 8 minutes away. The University Medical City is a three-minute drive within the camps.
