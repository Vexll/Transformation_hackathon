Anti-Harassment
At King Saud University, we respect each employee and student for who they are and cherish the range of experiences they bring to the university. At the university, we also believe that a constructive and healthy educational environment must be free of any form of harassment, physical or otherwise, that hinders the academic, social, and mental well-being of university affiliates.  As such, King Saud University has adopted a zero-tolerance anti-discrimination and harassment policy. Regardless of color, sex, ethnic or tribal origin, religion, age, disability, marital status, citizenship, genetic information, pregnancy, or any other trait protected by Saudi law, we firmly believe everyone deserves to be treated with equality, respect, and dignity. Please file a complaint at the following link if you think you or someone you know at the university have been the victim of any form of discrimination or harassment or corruption or human right violation. We take every complaint seriously and with confidentiality. Every complaint will be thoroughly investigated, and action will be swift.
In 16-9-1439 H a Royal Decree for anti-harassment in the work place was issued and in 19-9-1444 H, it was amended. It holds all governmental entities the responsibilities to fight every form of harassment including taking advantage of one's position and severely discipline those who engage in such conducts.
